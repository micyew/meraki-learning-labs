# Getting started with the ExCap Learning Lab

The Cisco Meraki ExCap API provides a flexible way of creating a custom WiFi Hotspot splash page. 

## Prerequisites
* Cisco Meraki access point
* NodeJS
* MongoDB
* Basic JavaScript knowledge

## Working with the Meraki Dashboard
For this lab, a Meraki Dashboard as been preconfigured. By logginging into the Dashboard, you should
be able to configure the WiFi network SSID, Splash Page URL and additional settings to test the application.

> Meraki Dashboard: https://n149.meraki.com/Learning-Lab/n/4O0byavc/manage/dashboard

> Username: *excap@ikarem.com*

> Password: *ikarem123!*


Once logged in, you will have access to the lab network. 

### Configure SSID

> Navigate to Wireless --> Configure --> SSIDs

A list of SSIDs will be avaiable to enable/rename for this lab. 

Select a disabled SSID, rename it to **"excap-yourname"**, and enable the SSID. 

This is a shared lab/access point so **please disable your SSID once completed.**

### Configure Access Control
> Navigate to Wireless --> Configure --> Access Control : *select your SSID from the dropdown menu*

Set the Splash Page to either **Click-through** or **Sign-on** (depending on the lab section)

Set the Walled Garden to `127.0.0.1`

Set the IP Assignment to **bridge mode**

### Configure Splash Page

> Navigate to Wireless --> Configure --> Splash Page

Set the URL to: `http://127.0.0.1:8181/click` or `http://127.0.0.1:8181/signon` (depending on the lab section)

## Installing the Source Code 

> Download the source code from GitHub to your lab station.
```
git clone https://github.com/dexterlabora/excap.git
cd excap
npm install
```

Note: The NodeJS and MongoDB dependencies should already be installed on the lab machine.

You can verify this by typing `node --version` and `mongo --version` to see the currently installed version.

## Running the Application
> Make sure you are in the **excap** directory created by the *git* clone operation.

`node app.js`

#### Verify the Application is running
```
~/github/excap ] $ node app.js

Server listening on port 8181

```

## Troubleshooting

> If the application fails to start and any mention of MongoDB is in the error, there is a good chance that MongoDB is not running.

        process.nextTick(function() { throw err; })
                                            ^

```

This can usually be fixed by just typing `mongod` or `sudo mongod` at the command prompt to start the database service.
