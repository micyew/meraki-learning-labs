# WiFi Hotspot - Cisco Meraki ExCap & NodeJS

People love to stay connected, but the cellular network is not always reliable and data plans are expensive for tourists.

The IoL French cafe, bed & breakfast has a solution, a WiFi hotspot!

By using the Cisco[ Meraki][1] access points, they can easily provide a cloud managed wireless LAN but they also want to deliver a bit of branding, terms of service and maybe collect some client details before providing this service. Luckily, Meraki offers an external captive portal API (a.k.a. ExCap) to do just that.

* Build a click-through guest splash page to deliver a customized user experience for client on-boarding.
* Build a sign-on restricted splash page with authentication which could support enhanced access.


## Meraki Dashboard

First you need to have a Meraki wireless access point. If you are a business and would like to obtain an AP to get a feel for the technology, just watch a [webinar][2] for an hour and Meraki will send you one for FREE and include a 3 year license. They can also get you trial gear to test out the full stack of products such as switches and firewalls for your next project.

Once you have a Meraki Dashboard account and have the access point connected to the cloud, its time to setup the guest SSID.

> Login to the dashboard and navigate to:  
Wireless —> Configure —> SSIDs

There are two major options for a splash page configuration. You can either have a "click-through" splash page or "sign-on" splash page. This lab will cover both concepts and build a single NodeJS app to handle either method.

> Name your SSIDs.

In this example, there is an IoL-click and IoL-signon to support the different requirements.

The Click-through splash page is the most basic option but accomplishes general requirements for providing a guest WiFi hotspot. A guest will simply look for an open wireless network, connect to it and a splash page will be presented. This page will likely have the branding and maybe a form. By clicking the login button, the Meraki network will grant access to the guest and the session data can be stored as needed.

###Configure the Walled Garden

To provide access to the host server before login has completed. Be sure to block all access until sign-on is complete, or guests can go to non HTTP sites without authenticating.

### Custom Splash URL
Instruct the Meraki access point to redirect the guest to your splash page server.

# Coding with NodeJS
_Source Code [download ][8]_

The following sections dive into the source code for both Click-through and Sign-on methods. Be sure to clone the source code for the complete app, which includes the styles and misc code.

## Click-through

The following code section stores the session data passed by Meraki and additional information such as time stamps and form data.

When the access point intercepts a guest attempting to open an HTTP page (non-secure site), the AP will redirect the user to the specified splash page. The URL will be that of the host server and the page "/**click**" as defined in the `app.get('/click', function (req, res)` statement. Any Meraki defined parameters will be available in the "**req**" object and any messages sent back to the client browser will be stored in the "**res**" object. _Note: There are other bits of code, such as the "express" web server and mongodb-session modules that allow this code to work. The full source code will have this included with explanation._

Example of URL received by client via Meraki access point:

    http://myserver:8181/click?base_grant_url=https%3A%2F%2Fn143.network-auth.com%2Fsplash%2Fgrant&user_continue_url=http%3A%2F%2Fask.co.uk%2F&node_id=1301936&node_mac=00:18:0a:13:dd:b0&gateway_id=1301936&client_ip=10.162.50.40&client_mac=FF:FF:96:d5:d5



Once the data has been stored, a splash page will be sent to the client browser. By using the Handlebars template system, a dynamic HTML page will be generated with any supporting "session" data needed.

    ...
    // ################################################################
    // Click-through Splash Page
    // ################################################################

    // serving the static click-through HTML file
    app.get('/click', function (req, res) {

     // extract parameters (queries) from URL
     // this has been done literaly to illustrate what data is being exchanged
     req.session.host = req.headers.host;
     req.session.base_grant_url = req.query.base_grant_url;
     req.session.user_continue_url = req.query.user_continue_url;
     req.session.node_mac = req.query.node_mac;
     req.session.client_ip = req.query.client_ip;
     req.session.client_mac = req.query.client_mac;
     req.session.splashclick_time = new Date().toString();

     // display session data for debugging purposes
     console.log("Session data at click page = " + util.inspect(req.session, false, null));

     // render login page using handlebars template and send in session data
     res.render('click-through', req.session);

    });
    ...
### Splash Page: click.hbs

Here is an example HTML section that includes a form and will post back to the "/login" page for final processing.

```
<div id="content">
  <div id="container">
    <div class="header">
      <div id="icon_cell">
        <img class="text-center" src="/img/barista-lego.jpg" style="width:40%; margin:10px;">
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="continue">
      <h1>IoL Cafe</h1>
      <p>Please enjoy our complimentary WiFi and a cup of joe.</p>
      <p>
        Brought to you by <a href="http://www.internetoflego.com" target="blank">InternetOfLego.com</a>
      </p>
      <form action="/login" method="post" class="form col-md-12 center-block">
        <div class="form-group">
          <input class="form-control input-lg" placeholder="Email" type="text" name="form1[email]">
        </div>
        <div class="form-group">
          <button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block">Sign In</button>
          <span class="pull-left"><a href="#">Terms and Conditions</a></span>
        </div>
      </form>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="footer">
    <h3>POWERED BY</h3>
    <img class="text-center" src="/img/cisco-meraki-gray.png" style="width:10%; margin:10px;">
  </div>
</div>
```

### /login

Once the submit button has been pressed, the "/login" action will post the data back to the NodeJS server to store the form data and complete the login to Meraki and redirect the user to their intended URL.

```
    ...
    // handle form submit button and send data to Cisco Meraki - Click-through
    app.post('/login', function(req, res){

     // save data from HTML form
     req.session.form = req.body.form1;
     req.session.splashlogin_time = new Date().toString();

     // do something with the session and form data (i.e. console, database, file, etc. )
     // write to console
     console.log("Session data at login page = " + util.inspect(req.session, false, null));

     // forward request onto Cisco Meraki to grant access.
     res.writeHead(302, {'Location': req.session.base_grant_url + "?continue_url="+req.session.user_continue_url});
     res.end();

    });
    ...
```
